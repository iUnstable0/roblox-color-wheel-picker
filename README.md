# roblox-color-wheel-picker

This is my personal version of the Roblox color wheel picker, which is based on the original found here: https://www.roblox.com/library/6023759238/Colour-Wheel.

I've made a few improvements to the original model. Firstly, I added an automatic darkness slider size adjustment. This was to address an issue in the original model where it would clip out at the bottom/top of the darkness picker.

Additionally, I incorporated some mathematics to make the color picker follow your mouse, yet stay within the circle. This function applies when your mouse is outside the circle. ðŸ¤“

Instructions for installation:
Simply drag and drop it into your studio.

The files are available in the releases section for download. Enjoy!
